Yeah you saw that right. This new Microsoft confuses me almost on a
daily basis. Part of me thinks that this is awesome, and then another
part yells at me for thinking it is awesome.

I think it is great that Microsoft is looking to make good with the
open-source community. They are the second largest contributor to Docker
outside of Docker, and now this push to put SQL Server on Linux is yet
another attempt to break bread.

I think it is great that they are moving in this direction. I also think
it is somewhat sad that they are trying to re-platform one of their
products to work on something outside of their own platform. I can only
assume that this is a direct lesson learned from SQL on Azure and at
scale.

> all built in.
