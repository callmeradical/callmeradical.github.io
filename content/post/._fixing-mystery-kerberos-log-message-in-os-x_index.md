I didn't notice this message popping up until I upgraded a couple
machines to Lion, however once they were upgraded I began to see this
message repeatedly in the log, roughly every 10 seconds.

> com.apple.launchd:(com.apple.Kerberos.kdc) Throttling respawn: Will
> start in 10 seconds

launchd spawns a process that continually attempts to authenticate with
resources on the network.

I haven't done enough digging to know what exactly caused this change.
Regenerating the localKDC stopped this message all together so far. You
can do that by running this command.

`sudo /usr/libexec/configureLocalKDC`

Some people over on the Apple forums have seemed to point out that the
launchd rule defined in...

> /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.configureLocalKDC.plist

is broke, I haven't checked any newer installations but I would have to
think that this is fixed in Mountain Lion and Mavericks.
