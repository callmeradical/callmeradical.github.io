Well it is that time again. AWS re:Invent is right around the corner and
I will once again be making the trek to beautiful Las Vegas. I am
looking forward to seeing some familiar faces and even more excited to
see what new service offerings will be unveiled.

Plenty of people from [2ndWatch](https://2ndwatch.com) will be there @
booth \# 626 so be sure to swing on by and chat for a bit.

I will be live-tweeting and blogging from re:Invent during the keynotes
and will be providing some commentary around some of the new products
from various vendors.
