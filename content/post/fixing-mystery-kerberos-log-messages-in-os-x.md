I didn't notice this message popping up until I upgraded a couple machines to Lion, however once they were upgraded I began to see this message repeatedly in the log, roughly every 10 seconds.

>com.apple.launchd:(com.apple.Kerberos.kdc) Throttling respawn: Will start in 10 seconds

launchd spawns a process that continually attempts to authenticate with resources on the network.

I haven't done enough digging to know what exactly caused this change. Regenerating the localKDC stopped this message all together so far. You can do that by running this command.


`sudo /usr/libexec/configureLocalKDC`


Some people over on the Apple forums have seemed to point out that the launchd rule defined in...

>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.configureLocalKDC.plist

is broke, I haven't checked any newer installations but I would have to think that this is fixed in Mountain Lion and Mavericks.
