I am currently posting this article from Nitrous.IO on my Chromebook.

Nitrous.IO is an awesome service that is still currently in Beta, that
allows you to set up VM's ruby development. Currently it looks like they
are primarily supporting Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and GO with
frameworks such as Node.js, Rails, and Django. I was super excited about
this service a while back and am happy to see that it is working so
well. When you sign up you can create 1 free box using an amount of
"nitrous" and go into a web-based IDE for interfacing with your
environment. Nitrous is a resource you can gain by various methods
although it doesn't look like they have any payment strategy in place
yet.

I will be using this service all Next Week as I blog from AWS re:Invent.
