  Dad. Technologist. Space Junkie. D&D Nerd.

  I am Lars Cromley, a leader and Technology Fellow in Deloitte Space. I work
  with our government and commercial clients to tap into current and future
  opportunities in the space industry. My career spans over 20 years in
  software, distributed computing, and innovation.<br><br>

  As part of Deloitte's Office of the CTO, I help drive our technology strategy
  and vision, while also leading the efforts in our Space practice to build a
  future in space that's accessible, sustainable, and responsible. <br><br>

  Outside of work, I unwind by reading and writing science fiction, playing
  Dungeons and Dragons, and spending time with my wife and our three
  daughters. As I continue to help organizations realize their potential in
  space, I remain committed to educating others about our connection to this
  expansive frontier and our role in its future.
