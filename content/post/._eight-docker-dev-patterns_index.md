This was a post I had stashed away a while ago by [Vidar
Hokstad](http://www.hokstad.com).

He goes into some of the uses he has been seeing/using docker for. I
have used some of these and I am sure there are even more development
patterns out there now. The one I am most interested in is the
'installer' container as he calls it.

There are so many installers that come in the form of...

``` bash
$ curl http://what.is.this.bullsh.it | sudo sh
```

I can't stand it, I know I can't be alone on this.

This post is a little old and while I don't necessarily agree with the
'mount' my home folder in this container too frequently, I think there
are some good uses for docker in there (as if you needed anymore).
