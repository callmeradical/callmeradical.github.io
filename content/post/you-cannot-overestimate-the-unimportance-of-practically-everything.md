I don't typically subscribe to books about decision-making or "life hacking" or even time management.

I just finished my second read of Essentialism by Greg McKeown. I read through it the first time, and I was skeptical. After my second read, I can say I am a believer.

I can't recommend this book enough. I have had trouble divorcing myself from work for a while. I would always be the guy saying;

"Let me just finish this one last thing." 

or

"I just have to send this e-mail."

Essentialism has helped me tune out the noise and focus what really matters.

That last e-mail can wait, and there will always be one last thing.


Check it out.
