Well it is that time again. AWS re:Invent is right around the corner and
I will once again be making the trek to beautiful Las Vegas. I am
looking forward to seeing some familiar faces and even more excited to
see what new service offerings will be unveiled. Plenty of people from
2ndWatch will be there @ booth \# 626 so be sure to swing on by and chat
for a bit. \... [Read more []{.icon

::: content
Hey Andre, Look at this! Over the past 5 months I have been working on a
team of about five people on a shared workstation. Originally I had my
reservations about other people working on the same machine as everyone
else, but was quickly swaying to use it myself. Rather than set everyone
up on their windows laptops (which I still think is a huge barrier for
entry) our workstation was originally set up to help other people start
coding, developing, and learning ruby. \... [Read more []{.icon

# [Data Share](https://cromleylabs.com/post/weekly-data-share/) {#data-share .title}

::: content
Starting this week I am going to start sharing an assortment of links
weekly that I have found interesting through the course of my week.
These may not be necessarily be new. Also, I won't be shouting out to
anyone in particular but if you or your material end up on this list,
thanks in advance! Twitter CLI: t a command line twitter app which is
pretty awesome. National Vulnerability Database this has been around for
a while and might be old hat for most of you out there, however people
newer to system administration will find a wealth of information here,
relating to the security of their infrastructure. \... [Read more

# [AWS re:Invent recap](https://cromleylabs.com/post/aws-reinvent-recap/) {#aws-reinvent-recap .title}

::: content
So we are about half-way through day 1 of Amazon's re:Invent and let me
be the first to say, so far everything has been great. Registration was
amazingly fast, all of the staff have been incredibly polite, and
immediately after getting through registration I got my first piece of
swag! So it is not all sunshine and rainbows, there is some work to be
done. Today I started off with a hands-on lab getting my hands into
setting up security profiles with the IAM credential system and then
configurring instances of S3, EC2, and EBS. \... [Read more []{.icon

How often have you ever moved a file to trash, attempted to empty the
trash only to be greeted with an awesome message that states "Cannot
delete this file its in use blah blah" nonsense? While lsof can
definitely help in these scenarios. I prefer to use it for looking at
ports, examples after the break. lsof can... List all open files lsof

# [Command of the Day, purge!](https://cromleylabs.com/post/command-of-the-day-purge/) {#command-of-the-day-purge .title}

::: content
This is a common favorite of mine, especially when running VM's locally.
I have noticed with VMware fusion and Parallels there seems to be a
delay in freeing up memory. If you you like things that make you happy,
you will likely enjoy this: \$ purge Open up activity monitor Open a
terminal window Issue the purge command Watch your memory usage plummet
after issuing the purge command. Profit... Is this still relevant? \...

::: content
When setting up windows machine's for VPN access to OS X server's
builtin VPN service there is some tweaking that I have always found
necessary. Add this to your registry:
\[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\PolicyAgent\]
\"AssumeUDPEncapsulationContextOnSendRule\"=dword:00000002 Open
secpol.msc (click start \> search for secpol.msc) Local Policies \>

::: content
Let me start by saying this, I can't stand vSphere Data Protection,
however I feel that since it is offered for free, and there is little to
no management or maintenance for the virtual appliance, I see no reason
in keeping it from my vSphere environment. That being said I still
prefer to use Veeam for reliable backups of our virtual infrastructure
at least on a weekly basis. So anyway lets get started. \... [Read more

::: content
So if you are ever in a pinch and need to use a piece of optical media,
you can operate the CD-rom door via Command Line when you SSH into your
ESXi Mac Pro. For instance: (Enable ssh in the Security Profile of the
Configuration tab on the vSphere client. Remember to turn this off after
you are done.) \$ ssh root@esxi.host.machine \# cd /dev/cdroom \# ls \#
eject vmp.\*.\* That will then eject your tray, leaving you to
wondrously explore legacy optical media that no one wants. \... [Read
