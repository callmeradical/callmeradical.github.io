In our house, since February, we have tried to stay current on the effects and
precautions regarding Covid-19. I had stopped traveling in early March. Our
family had stopped attending various functions and get-togethers. We had
decided in accordance with the CDC, like many others we would begin isolating
and only go out as needed.

Isolation for us lasted about 4 weeks and we gradually started going back out
into the world. Trips to the grocery store and small trips to get supplies at
the convenience store. We started having limited contact and interactions with
people. We were restricting our interaction to a small bubble. As time went on
we decided to expand our bubble as it made sense. At first, that bubble was
only big enough for us and our neighbors. The kids play together regularly and
being so close it was hard to just keep them apart. So both of us reluctantly
agreed that our bubble would just be our two families.

As time went on the weather got nicer and we continued to spend more time
outside and we would hang out at a distance in our driveways and in our
streets. Our neighborhood is a nice new development with lots of young families
and tons of kids. In the summer, we typically attend a private lake where we
have a membership and we spend most of our days there with a group of friends.
We were beyond relieved when the lake opened for the summer.

In New Jersey, we were hit pretty hard in the beginning but cases continued to
trend downward. We decided we would start going to the lake and our bubble
expanded to include our neighbors and now our friends that attended the lake as
well. It was pretty easy for the adults to maintain distance at the lake and
the kids were careful enough to play with the friends they knew.

Time went on, the lake closed, and we felt like we had gotten some level of
normalcy back. Restaurants opened, you could buy toilet paper again, Lysol
wasn't worth more than gold. We started seeing more of our friends and family
and enjoying their company evermore. 

In the weeks leading up to the election cases had started to rise. My wife and
I had talked about the possible need to take greater precautions and possibly
return to quarantine again. We didn't think quarantine was necessary but some
common sense measures would be sufficient. We attended our bible study, hosted
at a friends house, wore masks inside the entire time, and remained distant
from each other the best we could. Later, we had a small gathering of family
members get together to celebrate the election and a small personal victory for
my career. This was on Sunday, November 8th, 

I was on a call and my wife messaged me with the dire message of "I need to
talk to you asap." 

On Monday, November 9th, me and my family were informed that our neighbor and
close friend had tested positive for COVID-19. We started thinking about who we
had come in contact with over the past couple days. We reached out to those
people and informed them that we had been in contact with someone who tested
positive for COVID-19 and were in the process of ourselves getting tested. As I
write this now my wife is going and getting a rapid test done. I had gone last
night and was able to get both the rapid antigen test and a longer test called the
polymerase chain reaction test, or PCR.

My rapid test came back negative last night about 30-40 mins after taking it.
The rapid-test, as reported by the administering physician informed me that the
rapid test was only about 60% accurate and commonly reports false negatives, in
order to be sure I would have to wait for the PCR results to come back in 2 to
3 days. So what do we do until then and what does this mean for our family and
maybe yours should you find yourself in a similar situation?

So the first thing we did was to use the
[COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0327-statement-covid-19-apple-app.html)
screening app on my iPhone.
The app was developed in collaboration with the CDC and there is a [website
version available](https://covid19.apple.com/screening) as well for those that
prefer android or another type of mobile device. Answering the questions I had
answered that I had been in signficiant close contact with someone who had
tested positive for COVID-19 and that I had felt some symptoms. I did not know
if the symptoms were related to COVID or not but I had been feeling body aches
for a couple of days and my wife had woken up with a scratchy throat. Our kids
meanwhile felt fine. The app had then taken me to another resource that was
specific to my state. 

Apple and Google together had created a contact tracing service for use by all
the states, and New Jersey happens to make use of that service. New Jersey has
a state specific app for
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nj.gov.covidalert)
and [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/covid-alert-nj/id1529622525) devices.
Using these resources I was able to find where to get tested, anticipated turn
around time, and further information for how to proceed. 

Now I got my test done last night, my wife had to wait until this afternoon, so
what did we do in the meantime? We followed the advice of the CDC and their
guidance on ["Caring for Someone Sick at
Home"](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/care-for-someone.html),
so we put my wife in isolation until she could get her test done. -

> * Have the person who is sick use a separate bedroom and bathroom.
> * Have the person who is sick stay in their own “sick room” or area and away from others. 
> * Try to stay at least 6 feet away from the sick person.

> In a Shared space --

So as I continue to write this, my wife's antigen test has come back negative
as well. We are going to continue to be cautious, shrinkle our bubble a little
more and adhere more closely to the guidance that the CDC has put out regarding
[Daily Activities and Going Out.
