::: content
I came across this post in a slack channel earlier today and thought it
was some pretty sound advice for those starting out in the container eco
system.

> First: Containers are immutable -- The OS, library versions,
> configurations, folders, and application are all wrapped inside the
> container. You guarantee that the same image that was tested in QA
> will reach the production environment with the same behaviour.
>
> Second: Containers are lightweight -- The memory footprint of a
> container is small. Instead of hundreds or thousands of MBs, the
> container will only allocate the memory for the main process.
>
> Third: Containers are fast -- You can start a container as fast as a
> typical linux process takes to start. Instead of minutes, you can
> start a new container in few seconds.
>
> However, many users are still treating containers just like typical
> virtual machines and forget that containers have an important
> characteristic: Containers are disposable.
