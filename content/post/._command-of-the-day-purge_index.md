This is a common favorite of mine, especially when running VM's locally.
I have noticed with VMware fusion and Parallels there seems to be a
delay in freeing up memory. If you you like things that make you happy,
you will likely enjoy this:

``` bash
$ purge
```

1.  Open up activity monitor
2.  Open a terminal window
3.  Issue the purge command
4.  Watch your memory usage plummet after issuing the purge command.
5.  Profit... Is this still relevant?

Check out the man page of purge for more insight to what this actually
does

NAME purge -- force disk cache to be purged (flushed and emptied)

SYNOPSIS purge

DESCRIPTION Purge can be used to approximate initial boot conditions
with a cold disk buffer cache for performance analysis. It does not
affect anonymous mem- ory that has been allocated through malloc,
vm_allocate, etc.
