Reading is definitely a passion for me. I love reading every chance I
get. So few books have stuck with me or have become even a flavor of the
week that I feel like I have to recommend Greg McKeown's Essentialism
again.

I came by another post, not long after reading Greg's book, talking
about priorities and the nonsense it creates.

> The Myth of Multitasking Yes, we are capable of doing two things at
> the same time. It is possible, for example, to watch TV while cooking
> dinner or to answer an email while talking on the phone.
>
> What is impossible, however, is concentrating on two tasks at once.
> Multitasking forces your brain to switch back and forth very quickly
> from one task to another.

Check out the whole post below for a good read.
