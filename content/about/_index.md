I’m a Technology Fellow in Deloitte’s Office of the CTO and leader in our Space Practice—but my story starts long before. I cut my teeth as a game developer and semi-pro gamer, swapped keyboards for carrier-deck deployments as a Navy aviation ordnanceman, then spent a decade launching and scaling startups’ infrastructure. Along the way I shredded in hardcore punk bands, collected a sleeve of ink (each design its own legend), and honed a knack for sci-fi storytelling and stoic pragmatism.

Today I design cloud-native, AI-powered systems—everything from satellite constellations to supermarket supply chains—that endure, evolve, and scale. I give talks, tell stories, and help organizations connect their work to the vast frontier of space, ensuring our future is accessible, sustainable, and responsible.

When I’m not architecting the next big thing, you’ll find me:
- Reading and writing science fiction  
- Running D&D campaigns  
- Exploring new ideas with my wife and three daughters
