  Building today’s platforms for tomorrow’s possibilities
content: |
  A game developer and semi-pro gamer turned Navy aviation ordnance man, Lars spent a decade launching startups and scaling infrastructure—before joining Deloitte as a Technology Fellow in the Office of the CTO and leader of its Space Practice.

  Today he engineers cloud-native, AI-powered platforms—from satellite constellations to supermarket supply chains—that endure, evolve, and scale. He gives talks and tells stories—infusing stoic philosophy, sci-fi narrative, and assorted esoteric passions into every blueprint.

  When he’s not architecting the next big thing, you’ll find him reading and writing science fiction, running D&D campaigns, or adventuring with his wife and three daughters.

  > “Lars helps our clients get to their tomorrow just a little bit sooner.”
