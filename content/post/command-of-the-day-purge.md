This is a common favorite of mine, especially when running VMâ€™s locally. I have noticed with VMware fusion and Parallels there seems to be a delay in freeing up memory. If you you like things that make you happy, you will likely enjoy this:

``` bash
$ purge
```

1. Open up activity monitor
2. Open a terminal window
3. Issue the purge command
4. Watch your memory usage plummet after issuing the purge command.
5. Profit... Is this still relevant?

NAME
     purge -- force disk cache to be purged (flushed and emptied)

SYNOPSIS
     purge

DESCRIPTION
     Purge can be used to approximate initial boot conditions with a cold disk
     buffer cache for performance analysis. It does not affect anonymous mem-
     ory that has been allocated through malloc, vm_allocate, etc.
