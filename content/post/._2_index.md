# [Benchmarking Amazon\'s Aurora](https://cromleylabs.com/post/aurora-benchmark/) {#benchmarking-amazons-aurora .title}

::: content
I saw this study by the folks over at Google and their 2nd Generation
Cloud SQL. The results they posted didn't exactly mirror what I saw when
running the benchmarks for myself. You can get the raw data here @
Github. Everything was stood up using Terraform, the benchmark tests
were conducted using Sysbench, and all data was plotted using R. Since
we didn't have access to Google's original data, we provided some
overlays in the post as an easy visual comparison. \... [Read more

::: content
Firstly a huge thank you goes out to \@mipsytipsy for this awesome post
mortem on what appears to be or what could have been one of the worst
outages of her career. Some context: our terraform config had been
pretty stable for a few weeks. After I got it set up, I hardly ever
needed to touch it. This was an explicit goal of mine. (I have strong
feelings about delegation of authority and not using your orchestration
layer for configuration, but that's for another day. \... [Read more

# [Container best practices from RedHat](https://cromleylabs.com/post/container-best-practices-from-redhat/) {#container-best-practices-from-redhat .title}

::: content
I came across this post in a slack channel earlier today and thought it
was some pretty sound advice for those starting out in the container eco
system. First: Containers are immutable -- The OS, library versions,
configurations, folders, and application are all wrapped inside the
container. You guarantee that the same image that was tested in QA will
reach the production environment with the same behaviour. Second:
Containers are lightweight -- The memory footprint of a container is
small. \... [Read more []{.icon

::: content
Reading is definitely a passion for me. I love reading every chance I
get. So few books have stuck with me or have become even a flavor of the
week that I feel like I have to recommend Greg McKeown's Essentialism
again. I came by another post, not long after reading Greg's book,
talking about priorities and the nonsense it creates. The Myth of
Multitasking Yes, we are capable of doing two things at the same time.

# [SQL Server on Linux?](https://cromleylabs.com/post/sql-server-on-linux/) {#sql-server-on-linux .title}

::: content
Yeah you saw that right. This new Microsoft confuses me almost on a
daily basis. Part of me thinks that this is awesome, and then another
part yells at me for thinking it is awesome. I think it is great that
Microsoft is looking to make good with the open-source community. They
are the second largest contributor to Docker outside of Docker, and now
this push to put SQL Server on Linux is yet another attempt to break
bread. \... [Read more []{.icon

::: content
I don't typically subscribe to books about decision-making or "life
hacking" or even time management. I just finished my second read of
Essentialism by Greg McKeown. I read through it the first time, and I
was skeptical. After my second read, I can say I am a believer. I can't
recommend this book enough. I have had trouble divorcing myself from
work for a while. I would always be the guy saying; \... [Read more

::: content
To go along with a talk I am doing this week, I created a demo project
to reinforce the idea behind ephemeral architecture and infrastructure
as code. We create two S3 buckets for the purpose of intake and another
to serve out a static site we will be generating using ECS. The first
bucket is a place to drop photos which then triggers a lambda function,
we will call this photo_bucket. \... [Read more []{.icon

::: content
After watching \@kelseyhightower's speech at Strangeloop 2015. I was
really impressed at the ease of instruction and demonstration he showed.
I had not played with Kubernetes aside from using the kube-up.sh script
in the github repo with the EC2 provider. He starts off the talk by
saying: \> How would you design your infrastructure if you could never
login? I have worked with clients and have said these exact words. It
immediately grabbed my attention. \... [Read more []{.icon

# [Eight Docker Development Patterns](https://cromleylabs.com/post/eight-docker-dev-patterns/) {#eight-docker-development-patterns .title}

::: content
This was a post I had stashed away a while ago by Vidar Hokstad. He goes
into some of the uses he has been seeing/using docker for. I have used
some of these and I am sure there are even more development patterns out
there now. The one I am most interested in is the 'installer' container
as he calls it. There are so many installers that come in the form of...

::: content
So I have been on a bit of a kick with Docker. I have been in Boston
talking about it, giving webinars on it, and using it just about
everywhere in every which way I can. One of the first things I realized
is that I hate installing dependencies on all of my things. Installing
ruby, git, gcc, and not to mention all the gems that I need to run. \...
