Starting this week I am going to start sharing an assortment of links
weekly that I have found interesting through the course of my week.
These may not be necessarily be new. Also, I won't be shouting out to
anyone in particular but if you or your material end up on this list,
thanks in advance!

-   [Twitter CLI: t](https://github.com/sferik/t) a command line twitter
    app which is pretty awesome.

-   [National Vulnerability Database](http://nvd.nist.gov/home.cfm) this
    has been around for a while and might be old hat for most of you out
    there, however people newer to system administration will find a
    wealth of information here, relating to the security of their
    infrastructure.

-   [netcat - swiss army knife of
    networking](http://mylinuxbook.com/linux-netcat-command/) There are
    so many different ways to use netcat, I think my favorite is the
    impromptu chat server or file transmission.

The last two were sent to me from some colleagues earlier in the year
that attended the Burlington Ruby Conference this year. I just finally
got around to checking them out. Thanks \@Tamman!

-   [Zero downtime Deploys @ Burlington Ruby
    2013](http://confreaks.com/videos/2618-btvruby2013-particular-particulars-about-zero-downtime-deploys)

-   [Realtime Rails @ Burlington Ruby
    Conference](http://confreaks.com/videos/2618-btvruby2013-particular-particulars-about-zero-downtime-deploys)

Thanks to those that have shared this information, you have all made my
life a little bit easier.
