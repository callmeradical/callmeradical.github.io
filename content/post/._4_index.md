::: content
While transitioning a website built in .NET there came a time to move
the server to something a little more robust... like Linux! The
following steps are more for my benefit but they may help in a pinch. To
export the SSL certificate from your Windows Server: Run "mmc.exe" from
Start-\>Run menu; Open "File"-\>"Add/Remove Snap-in"; Click on "Add..."
button, select "Certificates" option, click "Add", select "Computer
account"; Next; Finish; Close "Add standalone snap-in"; close
"Add/Remove snap-in" by "Ok" button; Open "Personal" folder and find
corresponding certificate; Right click on "Certificates", select "All
tasks"-\>"Export"; On "Certificate export wizard" click Next, select
"Yes, export the private key", select "Personal Information Exchange"
format, click Next, enter password, select file, click Finish. \...

I had a problem logging into the vCenter vSphere web client earlier this
week and was greeted with a message stating "Failed to connect to VMware
Lookup Service." More after the jump for the solution. At first I tried
this method, which is outlined here, Yellow-bricks Precise error: Failed
to connect to VMware Lookup Service. SSL certificate verification
failed. I had been playing around in my lab and I am guessing this error
was caused by the fact that I changed the hostname of my vCenter Server
Appliance after configuring it. \... [Read more []{.icon

::: content
Well here is the first post to this blog with some substance to it! Here
is a little backstory on the situation. I found myself almost
immediately scouring the internet one morning when my boss had told me
there was a problem with our server (at this point in time it was our
only server) that was currently running OS X 10.7, Lion. I was not a fan
of Lion server as it was a major departure from the server OS we all
knew and loved. \... [Read more []{.icon

I am currently posting this article from Nitrous.IO on my Chromebook.
Nitrous.IO is an awesome service that is still currently in Beta, that
allows you to set up VM's ruby development. Currently it looks like they
are primarily supporting Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and GO with
frameworks such as Node.js, Rails, and Django. I was super excited about
this service a while back and am happy to see that it is working so
well. \... [Read more []{.icon

out more information here - Puma. and if that is too much to read, it
can be summarized here... Puma is a very lightweight and incredibly fast
web server that was built for speed and parallelism. For comparisions of

::: content
So I had a hard time understanding what exactly boxen was used for at
first. I also didn't really see much value other than setting a "base"
system. However after working with puppet and reading some of the other
posts by Gary Larizza I think that boxen can really be summed up into an
intelligently designed way to run puppet in an organization that
requires more freedom for its users than typical. \... [Read more

::: content
An easy methodology of "stamping" your commits would be to create an
environment varible to store the return value of: git describe --always
This should by default always return the most recent tagged release or
branch name. You can store this variable in the environment.rb file of
your project by appending this line of code: APP_VERSION = git describe
\--always unless defined? APP_VERSION This was originally retrieved from
this fine human being Daniel Pietzsch
