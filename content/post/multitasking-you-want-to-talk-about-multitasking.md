Reading is definitely a passion for me. I love reading every chance I get. So few books have stuck with me or have become even a flavor of the week that I feel like I have to recommend Greg McKeown's Essentialism again.

I came by another post, not long after reading Greg's book, talking about priorities and the nonsense it creates.

>The Myth of Multitasking
Yes, we are capable of doing two things at the same time. It is possible, for example, to watch TV while cooking dinner or to answer an email while talking on the phone.

>What is impossible, however, is concentrating on two tasks at once. Multitasking forces your brain to switch back and forth very quickly from one task to another.
