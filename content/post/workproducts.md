While at a conference in Pittsburgh last month, I talked with someone that is
an independent consultant. While speaking with this person, they had made a
small confession. He was basically "being paid to sit around," and did not have
anything to show for his work. He was nervous that the client would eventually
end this engagement. I asked for a few examples of his day-to-day and how he
spends his time at this client. He had talked about shadowing some of their
people, the procurement process, onboarding new tools or vendors, and process
refinement. I followed up by asking him what work products do you produce
during these sessions or activities? Working in this way did not seem like such
a novel concept to me at the time; it's kind of just how I work.

Whenever I begin working on something, I think about how I am going to capture
my work. Even if that work is not a deliverable, it is data that should inform
deliverable. It could be notes, a diagram, a recording, whatever form it might
take. There are a couple of reasons. I like working this way. First, it gives
you "tangible" information to work with by making your work visible. Capturing
information has the added benefit of being able to "show" your work. Sometimes
showing your work can be more helpful for yourself than your client or
customer. When working on long term engagements or with a demanding customer,
you can, at times, feel like the work you are doing is meaningless. Being able
to reference your work products in aggregate can help you develop a value
stream that puts all work into perspective. If you don't see the value in what
you are doing, you owe it to your customer to tell them as much.

Secondly, when you attend a meeting, someone is willing to give you their
time, and you have made a promise that you are going to provide them with
yours. Time is valuable to everyone, maybe not valued, but we should put forth
the effort. Putting forth the effort to me means attempting to work as hard as
the organizer or presented to understand the information or topic being
presented. Being present, capturing notes, actively listening. We owe it to
ourselves as much as anyone else. Treating the output of your meetings as work
products gives you a chance to curate the questions that arise and the lessons
learned. Following up on that creates information that informs a deliverable.

Lastly, I think by creating work products in whatever you are doing on a
project, whether consulting or not, you are capturing information for
posterity and collaboration. Creation of a work product makes work visible and
is easier to share that knowledge.
