I don't typically subscribe to books about decision-making or "life
hacking" or even time management.

I just finished my second read of Essentialism by Greg McKeown. I read
through it the first time, and I was skeptical. After my second read, I
can say I am a believer.

I can't recommend this book enough. I have had trouble divorcing myself
from work for a while. I would always be the guy saying;

"Let me just finish this one last thing."

or

"I just have to send this e-mail."

Essentialism has helped me tune out the noise and focus what really
matters.

That last e-mail can wait, and there will always be one last thing.

Check it out.

[Essentialism, buy it on
Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1453951553&sr=1-1&keywords=essentialism+the+disciplined+pursuit+of+less)
