Well it is that time again. AWS re:Invent is right around the corner and I will 
once again be making the trek to beautiful Las Vegas. I am looking forward to 
seeing some familiar faces and even more excited to see what new service 
offerings will be unveiled.

Plenty of people from [2ndWatch](https://2ndwatch.com) will be there @ booth # 626 
so be sure to swing on by and chat for a bit.

I will be live-tweeting and blogging from re:Invent during the keynotes and will 
be providing some commentary around some of the new products from various vendors.
